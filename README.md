Evaluation of classification models
===========================================

This code shows you some functions of the scikit python library with which you can
evaluate the quality of your classification models.

check out: http://www.coding-maniac.com for the video and further explanations. 

I needed to compress the data-file since it was to big to upload it to github.
Please unpack the file into the data folder to get the script working without any changes.
